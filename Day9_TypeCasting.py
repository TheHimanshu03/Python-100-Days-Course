# Type Casting : The conversion of one data type into another data type.
a = "1"
b = "4"
print (a + b) 
#it will give output as 14 because a and b are string.

c= 5
d =6
print (c + d)
#it will give output as 11 because c and d are integers.

'''There are two types of TypeCasting:'''
'''   Implicit TypeCasting : When we force the system to change the data type.
        x = '5'
        y = '4'
        print( int(x) + int(y)) # this will change the string data type in integer data type
'''
'''   Explicit TypeCasting : when the system will automatic change the data type.
        x = 5.6
        y = 4
        print( x + y) # This will change the interger data type into float data type.
